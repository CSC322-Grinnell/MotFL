# Mothers on the Front Line (MotFL

Mothers on the Frontline is founded and run by mothers of children with mental health challenges to promote caregiver healing and childrenâ€™s mental health advocacy through storytelling.

Our vision is a world in which mental health is destigmatized, respected and prioritized as an integral part of the overall health of individuals, families, and communities.
